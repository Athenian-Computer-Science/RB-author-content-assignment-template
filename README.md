# Writing content for ReadingBat and CodingBat

This is a chance for you to write exercises for ReadingBat and/or CodingBat! If you're just starting your Python journey, stick with topics we've covered already. If you have studied Python before, feel free to write exercises for anything you want (in Python, of course).

## Notes
* Both templates have comments that are intended to guide you or be placeholders. Read and use them!
* A template file (RBtemplate.py) is included for you. ReadingBat exercises should have the same format. Feel free to copy and paste from the template into my_code.py
* The first line (@some text) is called a decorator. Use that to put a short description for the end user.
  * Yes, you need the comment symbol in front of it.
* You will have 2 functions to write.
  * Function 1 is the one the user will see. Change the name and what it does and returns.
  * Function 2 contains the cases you want the user to address. In the print statements, call your function and give it whatever arguments you want. Don't change the name of this one - it needs to be called `main`. 
* Run your code and make sure it runs correctly.  
* If you write CodingBat exercises, there is a separate template for you. Be sure to fill out the hint at the top.

## Testing your code
* After you have tested your exercise yourself, you can decide if you want to test it using pytest or on ReadingBat. See Megan for help with either.
 * To test with pytest, you will modify the my_test.py file.
 * To test on ReadingBat, we'll run it in a simulated website to be sure everything works. (This requires a bit more time.)
